The emergency has been handled. The user input is: '{{ user_input }}'
Provide a final response, either reassuring the user if it was an emergency, and ask them to follow the steps in the earlier message. Or if it was a message, ask if there's anything else you can help with.

Your response should be in the following format:
{
    "is_emergency": boolean,
    "response": "Your final response to the user"
}
